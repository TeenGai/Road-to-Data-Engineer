# Road to Data Engineer by DataTH

***WELCOME*** everyone to this project, which is my very first project in Data Engineering field! :flushed:

First of all, I am also one of many people who is currently transitioning into `Data Engineering` career. I'm eager to learn more and develop technical skills to achieve my goals.

Recently, I participated in a Data Engineering Online Course by `DataTH`, where I gained knowledge of end-to-end data workflows, including `Data Ingestion`, `Data Transformation`, `ETL/ELT Process`, `Cloud Computing on Google Cloud Platform`, and more.  

In this project, I will showcase what I have done through the course, with adding new section called `Analysis` where I added additional analysis requirements for further visualization. Additionally, I also adjusted some code in Cleaning and Pipeline sections as well.

### [Data Collection](Collect_data)

In this section, I learned how to `collect data` from various sources (e.g. MySQL Database, Rest API) during my very first Data Engineering workshop.

### [Data Cleaning](Clean_data_with_Pandas)

Here, I performed data cleaning with `Pandas DataFrame`. This step took me about an hour to complete because of the variety of data patterns.

### [Create ETL Pipeline](Pipeline)
Combining the steps and code from the `Collecting` and `Cleaning` section, I created an `ETL Pipeline` using `Apache Airflow with Google Cloud Platform` (e.g. Cloud Composer, GCS, BigQuery).

### [Data Analysis](Data_Analysis)
After completing the `ETL Pipeline`, I got the-one-and-only-table named `transaction` in `BigQuery`, which contains all the data we have cleaned recently. I personally added some `analysis requirements` for further visualization.

### [Visualization](Visualization)
In this final section, I created a `dashboard` to display insights we got from the data align with analysis requirements, including `Sales Performance`, `Customer Insights`, `Product Insights`.
